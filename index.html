        <h1>Kruskal's Algorithm</h1>
        <p>Kruskal's Algorithm is used to find the minimum spanning tree of a connected, undirected graph. A minimum spanning tree is a subgraph that includes all the vertices of the original graph and is a tree (it has no cycles) with the minimum possible total edge weight.</p>
        <h2>Time Complexity:</h2>
        <p>The time complexity of Kruskal's Algorithm is primarily determined by the sorting of the edges and the operations on the union-find data structure.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sorting Edges: Initially, the edges need to be sorted by their weights. If there are E edges, the time complexity of sorting them is typically O(E log E) using efficient sorting algorithms like quicksort or mergesort.</li>
            <li>Union-Find Operations: During the execution of the algorithm, multiple union-find operations are performed to determine whether adding an edge forms a cycle in the spanning tree. Using a well-implemented union-find data structure, each union or find operation has nearly constant time complexity on average.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, the overall time complexity of Kruskal's Algorithm is O(E log E) for sorting edges. However, because E is usually no greater than V^2 in a connected graph, it can be expressed as O(E log V).</p>
        <h2>Space Complexity:</h2>
        <p>The space complexity of Kruskal's Algorithm primarily involves the storage of vertices and edges, as well as the union-find data structure.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Vertices and Edges: The space complexity for storing the graph typically requires O(V + E) space, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.</li>
            <li>Union-Find Data Structure: Additional space is required for the union-find data structure, which is typically O(V).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, the overall space complexity of Kruskal's Algorithm is O(V + E).</p>
        <p>In summary, Kruskal's Algorithm is efficient for finding minimum spanning trees, with a time complexity of O(E log V) or O(E log E) and a space complexity of O(V + E).</p>

        <h1>Kruskal's Algorithm</h1>
        <p>Kruskal's Algorithm is like a method to find the shortest path to connect all the points in a big web-like structure, where the connections have different lengths.</p>
        <h2>Time Complexity:</h2>
        <p>Think of time complexity like how long it takes for the algorithm to do its job.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sorting Edges:</strong> First, the algorithm needs to sort the connections by their lengths. If there are E connections, it might take a bit of time to sort them, about E log E time. But since E is usually not more than V^2 (where V is the number of points), it's like saying E is almost the same as V^2, so sorting might take around E log V time.</li>
            <li><strong>Checking for Cycles:</strong> Then, the algorithm needs to check if adding each connection will make a loop or not. This checking usually doesn't take much time because it's quite fast.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Space Complexity:</h2>
        <p>Space complexity is about how much memory the algorithm needs.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Storing Points and Connections:</strong> The algorithm needs to remember all the points and connections. This usually takes up memory space, about V + E space.</li>
            <li><strong>Union-Find Data Structure:</strong> There's a fancy data structure called union-find that helps in the algorithm. This also needs some memory space, usually about V space.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>In Simple Terms:</h2>
        <p>Kruskal's Algorithm is a way to find the shortest connections between points in a big network. It might take a bit of time, mainly because of sorting, but it's not too bad. It also needs some memory space to remember things, but again, it's not too much. Overall, it's pretty efficient for what it does!</p>

     <h1>Kruskal's Algorithm Analysis</h1>

    <p>From the provided output, we can observe the following trends as the graph size increases:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Execution Time:</strong> The execution time of Kruskal's Algorithm increases as the graph size grows. This is expected because as the number of nodes and edges in the graph increases, the algorithm needs to process more data, resulting in longer execution times.</li>
        <li><strong>Space Complexity:</strong> Similarly, the space complexity also increases with the graph size. As the graph becomes larger, both the input graph and the disjoint-set data structure used by the algorithm require more memory, leading to higher space complexity.</li>
        <li><strong>Density:</strong> The density of the graph decreases as the graph size increases. This is evident from the decreasing values in the "Density" column. As the number of nodes increases while the number of edges remains constant relative to the graph size, the density of the graph decreases.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Overall, these trends are consistent with the expected behavior of Kruskal's Algorithm, where larger graphs result in longer execution times and higher space complexity. Additionally, the decreasing density indicates that the generated graphs become sparser as their sizes increase, which is also a common characteristic observed in random graphs.</p>

    <h1>Kruskal's Algorithm Complexity Analysis</h1>

    <p><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> The time complexity of Kruskal's Algorithm is typically stated as O(E log E) or O(E log V), depending on the implementation. In your output, the execution times seem to align with this time complexity analysis. As the number of edges increases linearly with the graph size, the execution time grows accordingly. However, the exact execution times may vary based on factors like the hardware used, the programming language efficiency, and randomization in the graph generation.</p>

    <p><strong>Space Complexity:</strong> The space complexity of Kruskal's Algorithm with a union-find data structure is usually stated as O(V + E). Your output shows space complexities in the order of V + E, where V is the number of nodes and E is the number of edges. The observed space complexities align with this analysis, as the space required primarily depends on the size of the input graph (V + E) and the additional space for the disjoint-set data structure.</p>

    <p>Overall, based on the provided output and the stated time and space complexity analyses, the observed results seem to be accurate and consistent with the expected behavior of Kruskal's Algorithm.</p>

    <h1>When to Use Kruskal's Algorithm</h1>

    <p><strong>When to use Kruskal's Algorithm:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sparse Graphs:</strong> Kruskal's Algorithm performs well on sparse graphs, where the number of edges is much less than the maximum possible edges. This is because it considers edges in non-decreasing order of weight, making it efficient for sparse graphs.</li>
        <li><strong>Disconnected Graphs:</strong> Kruskal's Algorithm can handle disconnected graphs or graphs with multiple connected components. It will find the minimum spanning forest, which is a collection of minimum spanning trees for each connected component.</li>
        <li><strong>Edge-Weighted Graphs:</strong> When the graph is represented with edge weights, Kruskal's Algorithm can efficiently find the minimum spanning tree by considering edges based on their weights.</li>
        <li><strong>No Negative Edge Weights:</strong> Kruskal's Algorithm assumes that there are no negative edge weights in the graph. If there are negative edge weights, a different algorithm such as Prim's Algorithm or Dijkstra's Algorithm should be used.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>When not to use Kruskal's Algorithm:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Dense Graphs:</strong> For dense graphs, where the number of edges is close to the maximum possible edges, the performance of Kruskal's Algorithm may degrade. In such cases, algorithms like Prim's Algorithm, which have better time complexities for dense graphs, may be more suitable.</li>
        <li><strong>Parallel Edges:</strong> Kruskal's Algorithm does not handle graphs with parallel edges (multiple edges between the same pair of vertices) by default. It may lead to incorrect results if parallel edges are present in the input graph.</li>
        <li><strong>Disconnected Graphs with Constraints:</strong> If specific constraints are imposed on the minimum spanning tree, such as a requirement for a single connected tree or specific edge properties, Kruskal's Algorithm may not satisfy these constraints. In such cases, customized algorithms or heuristic approaches might be needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Negative Edge Weights:</strong> Kruskal's Algorithm does not support graphs with negative edge weights, as it may produce incorrect results or enter into an infinite loop due to the nature of the algorithm.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In summary, Kruskal's Algorithm is a versatile and efficient approach for finding minimum spanning trees in graphs, especially in scenarios involving sparse, edge-weighted, and disconnected graphs without negative edge weights. However, it's essential to consider the characteristics of the input graph and the specific requirements of the problem when choosing an appropriate algorithm.</p>

    <h1>Step-by-Step Explanation of Kruskal's Algorithm</h1>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Initialize Disjoint Set:</strong> We begin by initializing a disjoint set data structure. This data structure will keep track of connected components in the graph.</li>
        <li><strong>Sort Edges by Weight:</strong> Next, we extract all the edges from the graph and sort them in non-decreasing order of their weights. This ensures that we process edges from the smallest weight to the largest.</li>
        <li><strong>Iterate Through Sorted Edges:</strong> We iterate through the sorted edges. For each edge, we perform the following steps:
            <ol type="a">
                <li><strong>Find the Parent of Each Vertex:</strong> Using the disjoint set data structure, we find the parent (representative) of each vertex. This helps us determine if adding the edge would create a cycle in the minimum spanning tree (MST).</li>
                <li><strong>Union Operation:</strong> We perform the union operation on the disjoint set to merge the sets containing the two vertices of the current edge. If the vertices are already in the same set, adding the edge would create a cycle, so we skip it.</li>
                <li><strong>Add Edge to MST:</strong> If the edge does not create a cycle (i.e., the vertices belong to different sets), we add the edge to the minimum spanning tree (MST). We continue this process until the MST contains n-1 edges, where n is the number of vertices in the graph.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Return MST:</strong> Finally, we return the minimum spanning tree (MST) constructed using Kruskal's Algorithm.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>This algorithm guarantees to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) of the graph by selecting edges with the smallest weights and ensuring that no cycles are formed. The time complexity of Kruskal's Algorithm is typically O(E log E) or O(E log V), where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices, depending on the implementation.</p>
</div>
    <div class="container">
    <h1>Explanation of DisjointSet Class Arrays</h1>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>parent Array:</strong> The parent array keeps track of the parent (or representative) of each node in the disjoint set data structure. Each element parent[i] represents the parent of node i. Initially, we set each node as its own parent, meaning that each node is in its own separate set. This allows us to quickly find the parent of any node during the find operation.</li>
        <li><strong>rank Array:</strong> The rank array is used for optimization purposes, specifically for the union operation. It helps us maintain balanced trees within the disjoint set forest. The rank of a node represents an upper bound on the height of its subtree. When performing the union operation between two sets, we want to ensure that we attach the smaller tree to the root of the larger tree to keep the tree balanced and prevent it from becoming too tall. By keeping track of the rank of each node, we can make this decision efficiently during the union operation.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>In simple terms, the parent array helps us find the representative of each node, while the rank array helps us optimize the union operation to keep the trees balanced. These optimizations are crucial for the efficiency of the disjoint set data structure, particularly when used in algorithms like Kruskal's Algorithm.</p>
</div>
    <div class="container">
    <h1>Explanation of find Method in DisjointSet Class</h1>

    <p><strong>Finding the Parent Node:</strong> In a disjoint set data structure, each node belongs to a set, and one node in each set serves as the representative or parent of that set. When we call the find method with a node u, we want to find the representative node of the set that u belongs to.</p>

    <p><strong>Path Compression:</strong> The key optimization in the find method is path compression. When we traverse the tree to find the representative node of u, we update the parent of each node along the path to point directly to the representative node. This process compresses the height of the tree, making subsequent find operations faster by reducing the time needed to find the representative node.</p>

    <p>In simple terms, the find method efficiently finds the representative node of a given node u while compressing the path along the way to improve the performance of future find operations. This optimization is essential for maintaining the efficiency of operations in disjoint set data structures, especially in algorithms like Kruskal's Algorithm.</p>
</div>
    <div class="container">
    <h1>Explanation of union Method in DisjointSet Class</h1>

    <p><strong>Merging Sets:</strong> In a disjoint set data structure, the union operation merges two sets together by combining their representative nodes. When we call the union method with nodes u and v, we want to merge the sets that contain these nodes into a single set.</p>

    <p><strong>Rank Optimization:</strong> The union method includes an optimization technique called rank optimization. This technique ensures that the resulting tree remains balanced after merging sets, which helps maintain the efficiency of subsequent operations.</p>

    <p><strong>Comparing Ranks:</strong> During the union operation, we compare the ranks of the representative nodes pu and pv. The rank of a node represents an upper bound on the height of its subtree. By attaching the smaller tree to the root of the larger tree, we prevent the resulting tree from becoming too tall, which could degrade the performance of operations like find.</p>

    <p><strong>Updating Parent Nodes:</strong> Based on the comparison of ranks, we update the parent of one representative node to point to the other representative node. If the ranks are equal, we arbitrarily choose one representative node to be the parent and increment its rank.</p>

    <p><strong>Returning Success:</strong> Finally, we return True to indicate that the union operation was successful.</p>

    <p>In simple terms, the union method efficiently merges two sets while ensuring that the resulting tree remains balanced to maintain the overall efficiency of the disjoint set data structure. This optimization is crucial for operations like Kruskal's Algorithm, where we repeatedly merge sets while constructing the minimum spanning tree.</p>

<div class="container">
    <h1>Explanation of kruskal Function</h1>

    <p><strong>Converting Graph to Edge List:</strong> The function first converts the graph into a list of edges. Each edge is represented as a tuple (u, v, w), where u and v are the vertices connected by the edge, and w is the weight of the edge.</p>

    <p><strong>Sorting Edges by Weight:</strong> The edges are sorted in non-decreasing order of their weights. Sorting the edges by weight ensures that we consider the edges with the smallest weights first, which is a key step in Kruskal's Algorithm.</p>

    <p><strong>Initializing Data Structures:</strong> The function initializes necessary data structures, including the disjoint set data structure (DisjointSet) and an empty list to store the edges of the minimum spanning tree (mst).</p>

    <p><strong>Iterating Through Sorted Edges:</strong> The function iterates through the sorted edges. For each edge (u, v, w), it performs the following steps:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Union Operation:</strong> It checks if adding the edge to the minimum spanning tree would create a cycle. This is done by using the union method of the disjoint set data structure (ds). If adding the edge does not create a cycle, it merges the sets containing vertices u and v.</li>
        <li><strong>Adding Edge to MST:</strong> If the edge does not create a cycle, meaning the vertices u and v belong to different sets, the edge is added to the minimum spanning tree (mst).</li>
        <li><strong>Termination Condition:</strong> The function checks if the minimum spanning tree (mst) contains n-1 edges, where n is the number of vertices in the graph. If the condition is met, the function terminates the loop early, as the minimum spanning tree has been constructed.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Returning Minimum Spanning Tree:</strong> Finally, the function returns the minimum spanning tree (mst), which contains the edges that form the minimum spanning tree of the input graph.</p>

    <p>In simple terms, the kruskal function efficiently constructs the minimum spanning tree of a graph by considering edges in non-decreasing order of weight and ensuring that no cycles are formed while adding edges to the tree. This algorithm is used in various applications where finding the optimal connected structure of a graph is necessary.</p>

        <h1>Kruskal's Algorithm Breakdown</h1>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Sort Edges by Weight:</strong> First, sort all the edges in the graph based on their weights, from smallest to largest. This step ensures that you consider edges in ascending order of weight.</li>
            <li><strong>Initialize an Empty Minimum Spanning Tree:</strong> Create an empty set to represent the minimum spanning tree initially.</li>
            <li><strong>Iterate Through Sorted Edges:</strong> Starting from the smallest edge, iterate through the sorted edges.</li>
            <li><strong>Check for Cycle:</strong> For each edge, check if adding it to the minimum spanning tree will create a cycle or not. This is typically done using a Union-Find data structure. If adding the edge does not create a cycle, add it to the minimum spanning tree.</li>
            <li><strong>Repeat Until All Vertices Are Connected:</strong> Continue adding edges (in ascending order of weight) to the minimum spanning tree until all vertices are connected.</li>
            <li><strong>Terminate:</strong> Stop the algorithm when all vertices are connected or when there are no more edges left to consider.</li>
            <li><strong>Minimum Spanning Tree Obtained:</strong> At the end of the algorithm, the minimum spanning tree will be formed by the edges that were added without creating any cycles.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To summarize, Kruskal's Algorithm works by iteratively adding edges to the minimum spanning tree while ensuring that no cycles are formed. It prioritizes edges with smaller weights, gradually building the minimum spanning tree until all vertices are connected.</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Start with all vertices isolated:</strong> Imagine you have a bunch of points (vertices) in space, but none of them are connected yet.</li>
            <li><strong>Sort the connections by weight:</strong> Think of each connection between points having a weight, like a distance. You want to start with the shortest connections first.</li>
            <li><strong>Pick the shortest connection:</strong> Take the shortest connection (the lightest one) and check if adding it will make a loop. If not, add it to your collection of connections.</li>
            <li><strong>Repeat with the next shortest connection:</strong> Take the next shortest connection and repeat the process: check if adding it will make a loop. If not, add it to your collection.</li>
            <li><strong>Keep going until all points are connected:</strong> Continue this process until all points are connected in a way that there are no loops. You've now created the minimum spanning tree, which is the shortest way to connect all points without any loops.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Simplified Example:</h2>
        <p>Imagine you have a bunch of cities (points) and roads between them (connections) with different lengths (weights). Kruskal's Algorithm helps you find the shortest network of roads that connect all cities without making any loops.</p>
        <p>You start by picking the shortest roads and gradually adding them, making sure you don't create any loops. By the end, you have the shortest possible network of roads that connect all cities without any redundant loops. That's the minimum spanning tree!</p>

            Imagine you're trying to build the shortest road network to connect all cities in a country. You start from one city and keep adding roads to the nearest cities that haven't been connected yet. You keep doing this until all cities are connected. In this analogy, the cities are vertices in the graph, and the roads are the edges between them. Prim's algorithm works by starting with one vertex and gradually adding edges to connect it to the nearest vertices until all vertices are connected in the shortest way possible.
        </p>
        <h2>Kruskal's Algorithm:</h2>

            Now, instead of starting from a specific city, you have all the cities laid out and you're trying to connect them with the shortest roads possible, while ensuring there are no loops (because loops would create inefficient routes). So, you start by taking the shortest road available and keep adding more roads, ensuring they don't create loops, until all cities are connected in the shortest way possible. In this analogy, Kruskal's algorithm works by starting with an empty network and gradually adding edges (roads) to connect all cities (vertices) in the shortest way possible without forming loops.

    <h1>When to Use Prim's or Kruskal's Algorithms</h1>

    <h2>When to Use Prim's Algorithm:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Starting Vertex Matters:</strong> Use Prim's algorithm when there's a specific starting vertex that is advantageous or meaningful for your application.</li>
        <li><strong>Sparse Graphs:</strong> Prim's algorithm tends to perform well on sparse graphs, where there are relatively few edges compared to the number of vertices.</li>
        <li><strong>Efficiency Concerns:</strong> If the graph is represented using adjacency lists or if you need a single-source minimum spanning tree, Prim's algorithm may be more efficient.</li>
        <li><strong>Applications Requiring Rooted Trees:</strong> If your application requires a specific rooted tree structure, Prim's algorithm naturally provides this structure as it starts from a single vertex and expands outward.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>When to Use Kruskal's Algorithm:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Edge Sorting is Efficient:</strong> If edge sorting can be performed efficiently, Kruskal's algorithm might be preferred as it sorts edges by weight and selects them globally.</li>
        <li><strong>Dense Graphs:</strong> Kruskal's algorithm tends to perform well on dense graphs, especially when the number of edges is close to the maximum possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Parallel Implementation:</strong> If you're working in a parallel computing environment, Kruskal's algorithm can be easier to parallelize compared to Prim's algorithm.</li>
        <li><strong>Edge-based Decisions:</strong> In applications where decisions based on edges are more meaningful than decisions based on vertices, Kruskal's algorithm might be more suitable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>When Not to Use Prim's or Kruskal's Algorithm:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Negative Edge Weights:</strong> Neither Prim's nor Kruskal's algorithm can handle graphs with negative edge weights. If your graph has negative weights, you'll need to use algorithms specifically designed for such graphs, like the Bellman-Ford algorithm or Floyd-Warshall algorithm.</li>
        <li><strong>Disconnected Graphs:</strong> If your graph is disconnected and you want to find a minimum spanning tree for each connected component, neither Prim's nor Kruskal's algorithm directly applies. You may need to modify these algorithms or use other approaches.</li>
        <li><strong>Dynamic Graphs:</strong> If the graph is dynamic (i.e., edges or vertices are added or removed frequently), the traditional Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms might not be the best choice. Instead, you might need to use incremental or dynamic algorithms designed for such scenarios.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In summary, while Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms are powerful tools for finding minimum spanning trees, their suitability depends on various factors such as the graph's characteristics, efficiency requirements, and specific application needs.</p>

    <h1>Time and Space Complexity of Prim's and Kruskal's Algorithms</h1>

    <h2>Prim's Algorithm:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> If you have a small graph, it might take some time to find the minimum spanning tree. The time it takes depends on how many vertices and edges your graph has. If you have V vertices and E edges:
            <ul>
                <li>If you use a specific method called a "binary heap" or a "Fibonacci heap", it might take about (V + E)logV steps.</li>
                <li>If you don't use those methods, it might take about V^2 steps.</li>
            </ul>
            So, for example, if you have 10 vertices and 20 edges, using a heap, it might take about 100 steps. Without a heap, it might take about 1000 steps.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Space Complexity:</strong> This just means how much memory the algorithm needs to run. If you have V vertices and E edges:
            <ul>
                <li>If you represent your graph as a list of connections (called an "adjacency list"), it might take about V + E slots in memory.</li>
                <li>If you represent your graph as a big table (called an "adjacency matrix"), it might take about V^2 slots in memory.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Kruskal's Algorithm:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> If you have a small graph, it might take some time to find the minimum spanning tree. The time it takes depends on how many vertices and edges your graph has. If you have V vertices and E edges:
            <ul>
                <li>If you sort the edges first, it might take about ElogE steps.</li>
                <li>If you don't sort the edges, it might take about ElogV steps.</li>
            </ul>
            So, for example, if you have 10 vertices and 20 edges, sorting might take about 60 steps, and not sorting might take about 40 steps.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Space Complexity:</strong> This just means how much memory the algorithm needs to run. If you have V vertices and E edges:
            <ul>
                <li>It might take about E + V slots in memory, no matter if you sort the edges or not.</li>

                <li>It needs less memory if you represent your graph as an adjacency list instead of an adjacency matrix.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Kruskal's Algorithm:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Advantages:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>It's faster when your graph has more edges (dense graph).</li>
                <li>It's pretty good even without sorting the edges.</li>
                <li>It needs about the same memory no matter how you represent your graph.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>So, choose Prim's algorithm if your graph is sparse or if you can use a good method to speed it up. Choose Kruskal's algorithm if your graph is dense or if you don't want to bother sorting the edges.</p>

    <h1>Kruskal's Algorithm for Network Topology Design</h1>

    <div class="content">

        <h2>Representation as a Graph:</h2>
        <p>Represent the network topology as a weighted graph, where nodes represent devices (e.g., computers, servers, routers) and edges represent potential connections between devices. The weight of each edge represents the cost or distance associated with establishing the connection.</p>

        <h2>Identify Required Connections:</h2>
        <p>Determine the set of connections required to ensure connectivity between all devices in the network. This may include both wired and wireless connections, depending on the requirements of the network.</p>

        <h2>Apply Kruskal's Algorithm:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Initialize an empty set to store the selected connections (minimum spanning tree).</li>
            <li>Sort all the edges in the graph in non-decreasing order of their weights.</li>
            <li>Iterate through the sorted edges and add each edge to the minimum spanning tree if it does not create a cycle.</li>
            <li>Continue adding edges until all nodes are connected or until the desired level of connectivity is achieved.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Optimization and Analysis:</h2>
        <p>Once the minimum spanning tree is constructed using Kruskal's Algorithm, analyze the resulting network topology to ensure it meets the requirements of the network in terms of data transmission efficiency, reliability, and scalability. Optimize the topology by adding redundancy, adjusting link capacities, or incorporating additional network elements (e.g., switches, routers) as needed.</p>

        <h2>Implementation and Testing:</h2>
        <p>Implement the designed network topology in the physical environment, including configuring devices, establishing connections, and setting up routing protocols. Test the network topology under various conditions to verify its performance, reliability, and scalability. Identify any potential issues or bottlenecks and make adjustments as necessary.</p>
